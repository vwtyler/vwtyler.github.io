Hi, I'm Tyler.

I document real-world engineering work: community radio infrastructure at KAAD-LP, Linux/Liquidsoap streaming, and homelab systems that need to be reliable in practice, not just in theory.

This site is where I share configs, command-level walkthroughs, failures, fixes, and lessons learned so others (and future me) can reuse them.

If this work saved you time or helped you avoid an outage, you can support it here:
