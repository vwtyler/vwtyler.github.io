Hi, I'm Tyler.

I write about practical engineering work: building reliable systems, debugging ugly edge cases, and documenting what actually happened (not just the polished final state).

Right now, this includes two main tracks:

- **KAAD-LP / kaad-one work** — helping upgrade community radio infrastructure for reliability, with a focus on Linux audio, Liquidsoap, automation, and operational resilience.
- **Homelab and self-hosting** — services, deployment workflows, observability, and the occasional "this broke at 2am" postmortem.

## Why this site exists

I wanted one place to keep technical notes that are useful to:

- future me,
- station operators and collaborators,
- anyone solving similar problems in small, resource-constrained environments.

Most posts are written as case studies with configs, commands, tradeoffs, and lessons learned.

## How I work

I value systems that are:

- **reproducible** over magical,
- **recoverable** over fragile,
- **operator-friendly** over clever.

If a workflow depends on perfect user behavior, I treat that as a design bug.
